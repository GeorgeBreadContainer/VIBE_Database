## Aimbot
A [[#Cheat|cheat]] that automatically moves the [[#Cheater|cheater's]] [[#Cross-hair|cross-hair]] onto the enemy [[#Player|player]].
There are two main variants of this [[#Cheat|cheat]].:
- A regular version does this across multiple [[#Frame|frames]].
- A silent version does this across 2 [[#Tick|ticks]]: In the first one, the [[#Cross-hair|cross-hair]] locks onto the enemy [[#Player|player]] and in the second one moves the [[#Cross-hair|cross-hair]] back to the position, before the aimbot was activated.
## All achievements
A term used to describe a situation in which an [[#Account|account]] obtained every single TF2 [[#Achievements|achievement]] through an external program like [[#Steam Achievement Manager]] or through a [[#Game modes|trade]] or [[#Game modes|achievement]] [[#Community server|community server]].
This is not considered to be a [[#Cheat|cheat]] among TF2 community.
## Anti-Backstab

It can be activated when the [[#Classes|spy]] has a melee [[#Weapons|weapon]] equipped, is behind the enemy [[#Player|player]] and attacks said [[#Player|player]]. Spy's melee [[#Weapons|weapons]] do not have a delay between the swing initiation and the damage being dealt unlike all other melee [[#Weapons|weapons]].
## Ban

## Blockbuster
An unobtainable [[#Achievements|achievement]] for TF2, that requires the [[#Player|player]] to have their youtube video reach 100.000 views. Youtube simply deprecated the API that tf2 used. To unlock this [[#Achievements|achievement]] [[#Account|accounts]] use [[#Steam Achievement Manager]].
## Bot

There are 3 types of bots in TF2:
- [[#Cheating bot|Cheating bots]]

## Bot crisis
The [[#Bot|bot]] crisis was a period of time in the TF2 history, between 2016 and 2024 during which [[#Valve servers]] were infested with [[#Cheating bot|cheating bots]]. The state of the game was unplayable until [[#Valve]] [[#Ban|banned]] them.
## Bunny hop
A movement technique that generates more velocity in comparison to walking and tricks TF2 into thinking that the [[#Player|player]] that performed it, didn't touch the ground. 
## Cheat
An unfair advantage gained by the [[#Cheater|cheater]] during [[#Gameplay|gameplay]] through a [[#Cheating software|cheating software]].
There are at least 16 distinct cheats in TF2:
- [[#Aimbot]]
- [[#Triggerbot]]
- [[#ESP]]
- [[#Crit Bucket]]

- [[#Fake Latency]]
- [[#Ping Reducer]]

- [[#Auto Strafer]]
- [[#No Push]]
- [[#No Recoil]]
- [[#Skin Changer]]
##### Cheat detection
If the specified cheat isn't listed, it means, it can be detected, just by observing the [[#Suspect|suspect]].
To spot silent aimbot, watch for:
- This [[#Cheat|cheat]] does not work properly when using [[#Hit-scan]] [[#Weapons|weapons]], as [[#Player|players]] can easily spot it, by seeing that the [[#Suspect|suspect's]] [[#Model|model]] snaps to the positions, the silent aimbot moves to.
- Double flicking - a situation in which a [[#Cheater|cheater]] and the aimbot both move at the same time. If the directions do not match, you may see either an alternating pattern of the [[#Cheater|cheater's]] and aimbot's inputs or an unnatural movement of the [[#Cross-hair|cross-hair]] in all directions.
- Accidental kills - if there are at least two [[#Player|players]] near each other the [[#Cheater|cheater]] may go for a different person than the aimbot does, causing double flicking.
- [[#Projectiles]] going away from the [[#Cross-hair|cross-hair]] or where the [[#Cheater|cheater's]] model is looking at. While [[#Spectator|spectator]] and the [[#Source Spaghetti|entire tf2]] is clunky, it's easy to differentiate just by looking at the [[#Suspect|suspect]] if he's [[#Cheating|cheating]] or not.
- [[#Model]] suddenly snapping to a completely different position is a dead giveaway.
- Constant prediction of a random movement is also pretty much a dead giveaway.
To check if a [[#Suspect|suspect]] has all achievements:
- Go to the one's steam profile. Click 'Games'. Search 'Team Fortress 2'.
- If the [[#Suspect|suspect]] has 520/520, he has all achievements.
- You may check when he got them by Clicking on the 'Game Stats' then (PROFILE_NAME's) Achievements then 'Personal Achievements' and finally pressing CTRL+F, typing 'Metal Massacre' and checking the date.

##### Demo
A video file that displays each [[#Tick|tick]] of the game and responds to any local graphical alterations (for example different [[#GUI]]).
Any [[#Player|player]] can record a demo using a command in the [[#Developer console|developer console]].:

```console
record [Name]
```

or

```console
ds_record [Name]
```

The 'ds' stands for 'demo support'. Which allows [[#Player|player]] to use:

```console
ds_mark [Note]
```

to keep bookmarks of the desired moments of demos. The bookmarks are located in tf/demos/events.txt.

The ds_mark command can be enabled by typing:

```console
ds_log 1
```

to stop the recording use:

```console
stop
```

or

```console
ds_stop
```

The file will appear in the tf folder when using 'record' and tf/demos folder when using 'ds_record'. The demo files have .dem extension.

Any [[#Player|player]] can watch a demo, by typing:

```console
playdemo [Name]
```

or

```console
playdemo demos/[Name]
```

depending on where the demo is located.
Pressing [SHIFT + F2] will display demo [[#UI]] menu. This [[#UI]] allows to load and stop demos, change the playing speed and goto a specific [[#Tick|tick]]. [[#Player|Players]] cannot rewind demos.
You can enable automated demo capturing by going to Advanced Options -> Demo Support -> Recording Mode

##### Objector hell
[[#Conscientious objector|Objector]] Hell is an ongoing phenomenon in tf2 during which the [[#Player|players]] try to create either the most funny, shocking or offensive [[#Conscientious objector|objector]] there is. It led to normalisation of off-brand images on the [[#Conscientious objector|objectors]], due to the shear amount of them.
I'd like to address the fact that since regular off-brand is so common, there are probably worse things that one can find and [[#Valve]] stores all of the images on their [[#Item Server|item servers]] with absolutely 0 prior verification.
